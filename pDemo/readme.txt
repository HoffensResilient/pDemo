I have a function named "mean" in __init__.py
I have created the module using setup.py
and after installing the module,
I have used the module in calculate.py



You have to install "pDemo-1.0-py3-none-any.whl" file to use this module.
Location: "pDemo\dist\pDemo-1.0-py3-none-any.whl"

Relax, it is virus free.
